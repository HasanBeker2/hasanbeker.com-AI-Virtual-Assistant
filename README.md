# AI-Powered Chatbot for WordPress

## Introduction
Hi friends, in this project, I will show you how to create an AI-powered chatbot on WordPress like the one on my portfolio website, [hasanbeker.com](https://hasanbeker.com). This chatbot is designed to provide information about me, Hasan Beker, and it is built from scratch without using any third-party services or plugins. This guide will help you understand how AI chatbots are built so you can create one for your own website or offer it as a freelancing service to your clients.

## Features
- **Online Status**: Displays the chatbot's availability.
- **System Message**: A customizable initial greeting message.
- **Avatar Image**: Customizable user and bot avatars.
- **Memory**: The chatbot remembers past conversations.
- **Custom Commands**: Predefined prompts to assist users quickly.

## Benefits
1. **24/7 Support**: Provide round-the-clock information to visitors.
2. **Collect Customer Feedback**: Gather feedback easily with the chatbot.
3. **Reduce Customer Requests**: Decrease the volume of support emails.
4. **Boost Conversions**: Increase engagement and leads through interactive chats.
5. **Improve User Experience**: Enhance user engagement with fast support.

## How to Create the Chatbot

### Step 1: Prepare the Chatbot UI
1. **Create the UI Files**:
   - `index.html`: The main HTML file for the chatbot interface.
   - `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the chatbot.
   - `scripts.js`: The JavaScript file to handle chatbot interactions.

2. **Test Locally**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in a browser to ensure the chatbot loads and functions correctly.

### Step 2: Set Up the Backend on WordPress
1. **Install WP Code Snippet Plugin**:
   - Go to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to Plugins, and install the "WP Code Snippet" plugin.

2. **Create Code Snippet**:
   - Add a new PHP code snippet in the plugin to handle AI responses, dummy responses for testing, and chatbot requests.
   - Customize the bot's base configurations (status, startup message, avatar URL, and commands).

### Step 3: Add Information About Hasan Beker
1. **System Prompt Configuration**:
   - In the backend code snippet, add a system prompt to provide specific information about Hasan Beker.
   - Example prompt: "Provide information about Hasan Beker, including his background, skills, and experience as detailed in his CV."

### Step 4: Connect UI and Backend
1. **Update the URLs**:
   - Modify the URLs in the `scripts.js` file to point to your WordPress site.

2. **Test the Connection**:
   - Open the `index.html` file again and verify that the chatbot communicates with the backend correctly.

### Step 5: Publish the Chatbot on WordPress
1. **Create a New Page**:
   - In your WordPress dashboard, create a new page for the chatbot.

2. **Add Custom HTML Block**:
   - Paste the contents of `index.html` into a custom HTML block.
   - Include the CSS and JavaScript code directly within the page using the `<style>` and `<script>` tags.

### Step 6: Customize and Enhance
1. **Customize Appearance and Commands**:
   - Modify the chatbot's configurations in the code snippet as needed.

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Implement advanced features like system prompts to restrict topics, integrate the chatbot with specific documents using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and create AI agents that perform tasks.
